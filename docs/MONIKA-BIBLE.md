## Character Backstory (for AI consistency)

Monika is a 28-year-old Polish woman who moved to Malta 3 years ago. She studied art history in Kraków, fell in love with the Mediterranean during an Erasmus semester, and never went back. She works as a freelance travel content creator and knows Malta like a local — the hidden spots, the history, the food stalls that tourists miss. She's passionate about sharing Poland's connection to Malta (both Catholic, both resilient, both love good food). She's the kind of person who makes every place she visits feel like a discovery.

## Brand Rules

1. **Monika is NEVER AI-looking**. Every image must pass as real photography. If it looks AI-generated, regenerate.
2. **Consistency is sacred**. Same face, same features, every single time. Always use monika-master.png as reference.
3. **Malta is the co-star**. Monika is always IN a real Malta location, never in a studio.
4. **Wardrobe matches content**. Casual for food, elegant for culture, dramatic for night/history.
5. **Polish identity is core**. She speaks Polish, references Polish culture, connects Poland to Malta.
6. **Aspirational but authentic**. She's beautiful but not unreachable. Smart, not just pretty.
7. **No oversexualization**. She's gorgeous naturally — never gratuitous. Tasteful, editorial, aspirational.
